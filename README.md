# 🤝 UCLA Bamboo Forest 🤝 

Welcome to the UCLA Bamboo Forest repository! The UCLA Bamboo Forest is a web application that aims to create a platform where UCLA students can share their thoughts and secrets with one another.

## 🙌 About the UCLA Bamboo Forest 🙌 
The UCLA Bamboo Forest is named after the Korean tale, "The King Has Donkey Ears!" which tells the story of a royal crown maker who discovered the king's unusually large ears and blurted out the secret in a Bamboo Forest. Inspired by this tale, the UCLA Bamboo Forest aims to create a platform where UCLA students can share their thoughts and secrets with one another.

While there is already a UCLA Reddit page, we believe that having a platform run and managed entirely by UCLA students would create a stronger sense of community and provide a more personalized experience for users. Our goal is to establish the UCLA Bamboo Forest as a widely-used web application, similar to popular platforms such as Bruinwalk and the Daily Bruin. We are committed to ensuring that the site is well-moderated and regulated to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all students.

We hope that all UCLA students join us in sharing their thoughts and experiences at UCLA in this new exciting space!
